# MCP Server Test

A minimal Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and client demo for testing and experimentation. This project is built with TypeScript and demonstrates basic server-client communication, user data handling, and extensibility for MCP-based applications.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed codebase for reliability and maintainability.
- **MCP Server**: Simple server implementation for MCP protocol testing.
- **Client Example**: Basic client to interact with the server.
- **User Data**: Sample user data in JSON format for demonstration.
- **Easy Setup**: Quick start instructions for local development.
